        secondParagraph: "I find a graphic reprsentation of information helpful, especially when trying to events in context. This is the tool I wish that I had had before my second deployment to Iraq when I was trying to understand Iraqi foreign relations. ",
        thirdParagraph: "The next step will be to migrate the timeline from a CSS component to using SVG."

        title: "US Language Distribution",
        firstParagraph: "This site uses JQuery to make an AJAX call to the MapBox API and render the map.  The map is configured with layers that were uploaded and are based on GeoJSON files of census data from 2013.",
